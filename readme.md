# Financial inclusion research project in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda

Individuals and enterprises with financial inclusion have access to useful and cheap financial products and services (transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance) offered in a responsible and sustainable manner.

People who have bank accounts are more likely to use additional financial services like credit and insurance to start and expand enterprises, invest in education or health, manage risk, and so on, all of which can improve their overall quality of life.
Financial inclusion, according to the World Bank Group, is a critical facilitator for reducing severe poverty and increasing shared prosperity.

Financial inclusion is measured by having a bank account.

# Analysis
Despite the fact that all nine demographic factors were examined, only household size, age, gender, relationship with the head of household, marital status, level of education, cell phone accessibility, and type of job demonstrated a significant ability to influence an individual's decision to open or use a bank account.

It's also worth noting that Rwanda has a large number of people without a bank account, whilst Kenya has a comparatively high number of people who have/use a bank account. As a result, based on the data, a conclusion may be drawn about each country's financial inclusion.
