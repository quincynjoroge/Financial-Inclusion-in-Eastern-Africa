Financial inclusion research project in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda

Individuals and enterprises with financial inclusion have access to useful and cheap financial products and services (transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance) offered in a responsible and sustainable manner.

People who have bank accounts are more likely to use additional financial services like credit and insurance to start and expand enterprises, invest in education or health, manage risk, and so on, all of which can improve their overall quality of life.
Financial inclusion, according to the World Bank Group, is a critical facilitator for reducing severe poverty and increasing shared prosperity.

Financial inclusion is measured by having a bank account.
